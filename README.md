# Welcome to My Kaggle Repository!

Hello, and welcome to my Kaggle repository! This collection showcases some exciting data science projects I have worked on as an intermediate data scientist. Throughout the years, I have been passionate about leveraging data to gain valuable insights, make informed decisions, and develop innovative solutions.

## Updates: Embracing the Journey of Continuous Improvement

I am thrilled that this repository is not a static reflection of my past works alone. As a fervent advocate of continuous learning and improvement, I actively update this repository with newer projects I have recently completed or will be working on shortly. By regularly adding fresh content, I aim to showcase my ongoing growth as a data scientist and keep abreast of the latest advancements in the field.

The newest thing that I learned is about data scrapping. It helped me a lot when doing feature engineering for the ristek datathon competition. It was definitely something interesting that I think I will use in the future.

Notice that I have `Detik Scrapping` on my Scrapping Challenge folder. That is my trial to use the Detik unofficial API to do webscrapping. Please refer to [this github repository](https://github.com/Ucok23/detiknews_api) for more information.

## Purpose and Motivation

The primary purpose of this repository remains unwavering - to demonstrate my skills and abilities as a data scientist while fostering a platform for collaborative learning and knowledge sharing. With each project, I strive to delve deeper into complex problems, explore cutting-edge techniques, and derive actionable insights that positively impact me.

## Dataset

To maintain the integrity of the repository and adhere to GitHub's limitations on file sizes, I have carefully organized the projects. While some competition datasets may not be directly uploaded due to their large sizes, I have provided clear instructions on how to access the data effortlessly:

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle or the respective competition source.
2. Create a new folder named `Dataset` within the specific competition folder.
3. Unzip the downloaded dataset and place its contents inside the Dataset folder.
4. The code in the project should seamlessly read the data from this directory, ensuring a smooth exploration experience.

For competitions with smaller datasets, you will find a CSV file directly within the corresponding competition folder containing all the necessary data for the project.

## Continuous Learning and Growth

The journey of continuous improvement is at the heart of my passion for data science. As you explore the repository's projects, you will witness the progress I have made in the past and the evolving skills and knowledge I am cultivating through my latest works. Each project is a testament to my commitment to staying at the forefront of the data science field.

## Get Involved!

Your involvement and engagement with this repository are significant to me. I welcome fellow data scientists, learners, and domain experts to explore the projects, analyze the code, and share feedback or suggestions. Together, we can create a vibrant community that nurtures growth, sparks innovation, and collectively elevates the field of data science.

Thank you for visiting my Kaggle repository. As I continue to update it with new projects, I hope you find the contents inspiring and that they ignite your curiosity and passion for data science. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or ideas or want to connect. Happy exploring!
